# This is a program to determine the timezone using your location (automatically or manually)

# It should then request what the timezone you would like to see is

# It should then translate the time into the requested timezone. It should also be able to project what the time will be for the timezone you request if the time is input in your current timezone.

# Extension - compare multiple timezones.
